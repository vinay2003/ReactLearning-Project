# Currency Converter

A simple and responsive currency converter application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This tool allows users to easily convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

## Features

- **Real-time Currency Conversion**: Fetches live exchange rates from an API.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React for dynamic updates and seamless user interaction.
- **Fast Build Tool**: Vite ensures fast builds and hot module replacement during development.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool for modern web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **API**: Real-time exchange rates are fetched using a third-party currency API (such as ExchangeRate-API or Open Exchange Rates).

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinay2003/ReactLearning-Project/currency-converter
cd currency-converter
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Tailwind CSS Installation

If Tailwind CSS is not already installed, follow these steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Initialize Tailwind:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

3. Update the `tailwind.config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS file:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

### 4. API Setup

To retrieve real-time currency rates, sign up for an API key from a service like [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) or [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/).

Once you have the API key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:

```bash
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

To create a production build of the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized production build will be generated in the `dist` directory. You can deploy it on platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any static hosting service.
